# Translatoray
There are a lot of translation apps that didn't have the other dialect languages in the Philippines.

Then I thought, why not? Translatoray Mobile App.

The purpose of this Translatoray Mobile Application is to help the people that are still struggling in

have in any translation apps in the Philippines.
